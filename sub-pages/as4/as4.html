				<h2 class="subtitle">Info</h2>
				<p><strong><em>Destiny 2</em></strong> is a looter-shooter, online, multiplayer video game developed by Bungie. You start the game with three seperate classes to choose from; The Titan, The Warlock, and The Hunter. All three play very differently and that is some of the reason why this game is so fun. The game was released on September 6, 2017. Users have the role of a Guardian, they wield a power called Light to protect the Earth from different alien races. The race you first encounter in the game is called the Cabal, which is led by the evil warlord Ghaul. Long story short, Ghaul is a space Rhino that wants to take the Light from the guardians. The guardians were given the Light by the traveller, a mythical giant floating ball that died during a battle called the collapse. When it died it created a "failsafe" called the Ghosts. The Ghosts had the task of going out and finding dead humans that had the willpower to use the Light. Ghaul's plan was to invade Earth and harness the Travellers Light by trapping it in a dome that would block the Travellers connection to the Ghosts. He fails in the best way possible, being defeated by User.</p>

				<h2 class="subtitle">What is there to do?</h2>
				<p>Destiny has a very broad scope, there is many different things to play and do. There is three distinct "game-modes" you can play; <strong>Strikes, Crucible, and Gambit</strong>. Strikes are PVE, which means that you, the user, has to fight enemies. This is fun because you can go around, defeating enemies and getting loot, to further improve your guardian so you can defeat harder and more challenging enemies. There are a plethora of other PVE activites such as patrols, adventures, and raids. Crucible is a PVP game-mode, in which the user can fight other guardians. This is fun because you can test your wits agains your friends to show whos the stronger guardian. Finally, there is Gambit, a PVEVP game-mode. In Gambit, you get to fight both other players and enemies. This is fun because you have to multitask between killing enemies and killing other players, to get stronger gear.</p>
