				<h2 class="subtitle">Info</h2>
				<p><strong><em>Brawl Stars</em></strong> a mobile video game developed by Supercell. Its main focus is shooting opponents to do enough damage to kill them. The player has a plethora of characters to play as which is why the game is so addicting to play. The game was released on December 12, 2018. There are to main mechanics for damaging opponents, regular attacks, and super attacks. Super attacks are generated after you deal enough damage with your regular attacks. You can make your charcters stronger by winning matches to accumulate brawl tokens. Brawl tokens are used to unlock brawl boxes which then give you coins and power points. Once you get enough power points, you are given the chance to level up your character. Once your character is level 9, you are given the chance to get a star power. Star powers give your character a unique ability that can be used to make your character even more stronger than it previously was. Also when you win, you gain trophies. Trophies are used to tell how good you are at the game. By gaining trophies you can unlock new and special characters that are most likely stronger than your previous characters.</p>

				<h2 class="subtitle">What is there to do?</h2>
				<p>Brawl Stars has a very broad scope, there is many different things to play and do. There are 12 different "game-modes" that you can play but the most played are: <strong>Gem Grab, Brawl Ball, Showdown, Heist, and Siege</strong>. Gem Grab is a 3 vs 3 game-mode in which the player has to collect Gems that spawn in the middle of the map. The spawn every 1-2 seconds. Once a team has 10 gems, the win the match. Brawl Ball is a 3 vs 3 game-mode in which the player has to try to bring a ball thats spawns in the center of the map to the opposing teams goal. Once a team has scored twice, they win the match. Showdown is a free for all game-mode in which the player has to kill enough opponents to be the only one left standing. 10 players spawn in the beginning, and what makes this game-mode especially fun is the power cubes. Power cubes are collected around the map to give your character more power, so defeating enemies easier. Every enemy you defeat, you get one power cube. Heist is a 3 vs 3 game-mode in which the player has to damage the opponents vault. When enough damage is dealt to the vault, the vault breaks, and the team wins. Finally, Siege is a 3 vs 3 game-mode, like heist, the team has to damage the vault, however there are bolts that spawn in the center of the map. Once a team collects enough bolts, a massive robot spawns, which makes it easier to deal damage to the vault.</p>
